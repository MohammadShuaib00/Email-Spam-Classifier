## SMS Spam Classifier

This project is a machine learning model for classifying SMS messages as spam or non-spam (ham). It utilizes natural language processing techniques and a supervised learning algorithm to classify incoming SMS messages in real-time.

### Features
- Preprocessing of text data: Tokenization, removing stop words, stemming.
- Vectorization of text data using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) technique.
- Training and evaluation of machine learning models for spam classification.
- Real-time prediction of spam messages.

### Dataset
The model is trained on the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset), which contains a collection of SMS messages labeled as spam or ham.

### Technologies Used
- Python
- Scikit-learn
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)
- Streamlit (for building the interactive web application)
- Pickle (for model serialization)

### Usage
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Streamlit web application using `streamlit run app.py`.
4. Enter a message in the provided text box to classify it as spam or non-spam.
